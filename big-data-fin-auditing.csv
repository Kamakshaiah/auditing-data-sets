New sources of data, especially exogenous or external data that are generated outside the organizations, have opened doors to new ways of business measurement and information validation. Examples of exogenous data include social media, online searches, social networks, and news media. This paper discusses the state-of-the-art applications of exogenous data in the measurement and assurance of business reporting, ESG, and cybersecurity and provides potential avenues for future research. Furthermore, this paper speculates on the nature of the new paradigm of business measurement and assurance with exogenous data and the difficulties that are emerging. © 2022, American Accounting Association.

Ride-hailing service providers (SPs) usually collect users' personal data to improve their services via big data technologies. However, SPs may also use the collected user data to apply personalized prices to different users, which raises price fairness concerns. In this paper, we propose a smart price auditing system named Spas. Spas allows a user to purchase Fair Price Insurance in the form of Price Auditing Contract, then the price of ride-hailing service (RHS) order will be audited automatically once completed. According to the auditing result, the contract punishes misbehaving SPs and also compensates affected users automatically. By replacing an untrustworthy centralized auditor with carefully designed smart contracts, we construct a decentralized price auditing system which is trustworthy and transparent. We demonstrate a theoretical model for practical payment flows based on real RHS user data and we implement Spas in Hyperledger Fabric to show that decentralizing and automating price auditing for RHS with financial incentives is technically feasible. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",Auditing; blockchain; decentralized system; game theory; insurance scheme; ride-hailing; smart contract,Blockchain; Decentralized systems; Distributed ledger; Game theory; Auditing systems; Block-chain; Data technologies; Decentralised; Decentralized system; Insurance scheme; Price discrimination; Ride-hailing; Service provider; User data; Smart contract,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,Scopus,

The authors compare and contrast blockchains with existing legacy systems. The authors identify existing regulation, accounting standards, guidelines and potential amendments in under-explored areas such as taxation, accounting treatment of crypto-assets/liabilities and detailed auditing procedures. The study aims to highlight the trends, differences and gaps between academic and industry literature. The authors provide a behavioral, social, cultural, organizational, regulatory, ethical, accountability and managerial perspectives of blockchain adoption in accounting. Finally, the study develops two adoption frameworks. Design/methodology/approach: The authors' study follows (Moher et al., 2009) and (Briner and Denyer, 2012) methodology to conduct the systematic review and the steps are mentioned below. The authors construct a final sample of 452 from a preliminary search of three multi-disciplinary databases from 2012 to 2020. First, the authors motivate the review and formulate the research questions. Second, the authors aggregate relevant literature from both industry and academia and implement quality assessments. Third, the authors analyze the literature and construct the final sample of articles. Fourth, the authors conducted textual analysis, keyword frequencies and identify gaps, trends and similarities between academic and industry literature and develop the authors' frameworks Findings: The authors identify 3 (ABDC, B and A* ranked) journals as publishing top article numbers with the highest article count for 2017 with 96 articles in academia and 2019 for the industry with 21 articles. Second-highest publications for academia occur in 2018 with 77 followed by, whereas in the industry, publications occur in the year 2016 with 16 articles. Two co-authors appear most popular with 103 articles. Word clouds, a mind map and article theme counts are used to identify nine key research clusters: data management, financial applications, sustainability, accounting and auditing, business and industrial, education, governance, privacy/security and disruptive technology. Research limitations/implications: Systematic reviews can have selection biases mainly due to search and selection criteria distortions when constructing the final sample of articles. The authors address selection bias by refining our search keyword combinations by using different permutations and using keywords from articles already collected. The authors employ three databases and review the reference list of articles collected to add more articles that may have been missed into our sample. In addition, to avoid inconsistent coding of domains/themes and interpretations, the authors carefully review our domain identifications and all our analysis twice independently using two research assistants to obtain the same conclusions. Practical implications: The authors' unique contributions include reviewing additional papers, differentiating between industry, academic articles, common trends and gaps in much scattered prior literature. The authors identify existing accounting standards, guidelines, limitations and possible amendments required in future for blockchain adoption in accounting in taxation, accounting treatment of crypto-assets/liabilities and detailed audit procedures. Blockchains are compared with legacy accounting technologies and two frameworks for adoption developed. The authors' results could impact the understanding of existing regulation, accounting standards, future amendments, areas requiring clarity and future collaborative research between academia and industry across multi-disciplines. Practical implications to academics, professional bodies, regulators and industry practitioners exist. Social implications: The authors' study identifies significant implications on organizations, environment, culture and society in general. The authors identify that social engagement projects may be easily initiated and implemented with decentralized accounting information systems. Transparency and efficiency would change organization culture, ways accountants and even employees interact with each other and community. Anonymity in blockchains can be used for criminal activities. Coding of negative social dynamics to smart contracts may persist. Transparency of personally identifiable information may place individuals at risk. Regulation and standards would need to identify equity, ethics in blockchains which notwithstanding energy consumption, and could enable environmental protection increasing societal sustainability. Originality/value: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that compares academic and industry literature of 452 articles to identify gaps and similarities from 2012 to 2020 using three multi-disciplinary databases. The authors' study is the first study to in detail existing accounting standards, unclear areas, future amendments for International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) standards on taxation, financial reporting and all aspects of auditing procedures. The authors further categorize prior literature into these key areas and develop two frameworks (DAERPS and DAIS) that are linked to our review results and prior literature. The authors identify the impact of blockchain adoption on key stakeholders, regulation, society, culture, organization, accountability and ethics. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Accounting; Auditing; Blockchain; Disruptive technology; Governance; Smart contracts,,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,Review,Article in Press,Scopus,

As the focus of this book is Big Data and Service Operations Management, it is pertinent to understand Big data-blockchain relationship first before we can delve into Railway service operations and application. We begin by linking Big Data and Blockchain, followed by studying blockchain applications in various sectors, in order to provide a solid foundational understanding of the same. Thereafter, we set the context of Indian Railways, moving on to a structured understanding of the railway service and blockchain applications. followed by creating a specific provenance framework followed by conclusion, limitation. Big data signifies a novel technology paradigm for data that are generated at high velocity and high volume, and with high variety. The significance of Blockchain technology has drastically enhanced with the advent of Big Data because blockchain technology can help in recording and storing data for long duration. These technologies are envisioned as a game changer capable of revolutionizing the business drastically. Blockchain which is essentially a ‘distributed ledger’ has found applications in the financial and supply chain space. The value derived through this technology is in terms of transparency, veracity, track ability, traceability and auditing. The possibility of transparent information that can be traced to the origin of materials and processes and operations which are shared on blockchain ledger can provide product provenance, chain of custody and authenticity. Transport is an important service and represents the essence of service operations management. Railways is an eco-system. It provides a service that is asset intensive which has its own challenges in terms of maintenance and infrastructure. At the same time there are service concerns in terms of human safety and comfort. This provides a complex eco-system to work with. Blockchain as a digital tool intervention providing transparency, provenance and auditability can enhance the performance of the system This study attempts to create a model to understand the contribution of blockchain in the Indian Railway system. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Blockchain; Provenance; Railways; Service Operations,Big data; Blockchain; Digital devices; Railroad transportation; Rails; Supply chains; Transparency; Block-chain; Data operations; ECO systems; High velocity; Provenance; Railway services; Railway system; Service operations; Service operations management; Services applications; Railroads,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus,

Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled auditing technology not only facilitates accurate and comprehensive auditing for CPA firms, but is also a major breakthrough in auditing’s new environment. Applications of an AI-enabled auditing technique in external auditing can add to auditing efficiency, increase financial reporting accountability, ensure audit quality, and assist decision-makers in making reliable decisions. Strategies related to the adoption of an AI-enabled auditing technique by CPA firms cover the classical multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) task (i.e., several perspectives/criteria must be considered). To address this critical task, the present study proposes a fusion multiple rule-based decision making (MRDM) model that integrates rule-based technique (i.e., the fuzzy rough set theory (FRST) with ant colony optimization (ACO)) into MCDM techniques that can assist decision makers in selecting the best methods necessary to achieve the aspired goals of audit success. We also consider potential implications for articulating suitable strategies that can improve the adoption of AI-enabled auditing techniques and that target continuous improvement and sustainable development. © 2020 The Author(s).",Artificial intelligence (AI); Audit; Certified public accountant (CPA); Fuzzy rough set theory (FRST); Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM); Multiple rule-based decision making (MRDM),,VGTU,Article,Final,Scopus,

As information systems in companies become more complex, the traditional audit trail is diminished or eliminated. The importance of audit automation and the utilization of IT in modern audits has grown significantly in recent years due to both technological developments and changing regulatory environment. Automation of business processes has inevitably led to changes in auditing procedures and standards. Additional drivers of audit automation adoption include the ever growing complexity of business transactions and increasing risk exposure of modern enterprises. Therefore, the audit’s purpose, which is namely to examine the true and fair view of financial statements, is heavily increasing in complexity. On the other hand, the prevalence of the data paradigm has manifold impacts on the accounting-relevant processes. To cover the requirements to Audit Information System, we strive for the development of a framework for information mining from audit data. In this paper, we report on the framework we have developed in the department of Accounting and Finance. Our study identifies the management of audit alarms and the prevention of the alarm floods as critical tasks in this implementation process. We develop an approach to satisfy these requirements utilizing the data mining techniques. We analyse established audit data from a well-known data repository considering the dimensions of the data paradigm. This led us to a tentative proposal of a conceptual mechanism for an integrated audit approach. With the increasing number of financial fraud cases, the application of data mining techniques could play a big part in improving the quality of conducting audit in the future. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Audit data; Data mining techniques; Framework,,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus,

Faced with the goal of full coverage of audit and supervision, making full use of big data is the main method to promote the realization of the goal of full coverage of audit and supervision. Data analysis and utilization is an indispensable task of auditing. Actively exploring multidimensional and intelligent data analysis methods and developing big data audit cases are the new development direction of auditing. The convolutional neural network's excellent ability to extract data features well meets the relevant requirements of financial auditing. However, in practical applications, convolutional neural networks often encounter various problems such as disappearance of gradients and difficulty in convergence, which reduces its expected performance in financial audit applications. In order to make the performance of the financial audit model based on convolutional neural network more excellent, after summarizing the characteristics of genetic algorithm, this article applies genetic algorithm to the optimization of the convolutional neural network model. We applied genetic algorithm to optimize the initial weights of the convolutional neural network. The error sensitivity and learning rate changes of different hidden layers are discussed, the influence of different learning rates on the convergence speed of convolutional neural networks is analyzed, and the recognition performance of other algorithms on financial audit data sets is simulated and compared. We conducted experiments on the network structure and parameter optimization on the financial audit database. The results show that the recognition error rate of the convolutional neural network model with improved learning rate algorithm in the financial audit data set is lower than that of the multilayer feedforward network, so it has better performance. © 2021 Xiaoyi Zhang.",,"Big data; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Feedforward neural networks; Finance; Genetic algorithms; Information analysis; Learning algorithms; Structural optimization; Development directions; Error sensitivity; Information revolution; Intelligent data analysis; Multilayer feedforward networks; Network structures; Parameter optimization; Recognition error; Multilayer neural networks; accounting; algorithm; computer simulation; factual database; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Databases, Factual; Financial Audit; Neural Networks, Computer",Hindawi Limited,Article,Final,Scopus,

CA concept itself is not new to academic research, the majority of the papers published related to CA had largely focused in business organization as well as IA, while EA has not adopted the similar research pace in this area. With the arrival of big data, real-time economy and Industry 4.0, it is imminent that EA profession to relook at its fundamental approach and adopt technologies at a quicker and more relevant pace with accounting and auditing industry as a whole. As CA is still largely remains as concept and theories in FSA context and BDA application is starting to picking up pace in the EA profession, there is a research need to connect the CA and BDA together for a more coherent technological adoption discussion in the profession. Hence, this research proposed a CA framework model, with BDA as its core component, in the context of FSA. An archival research method with both qualitative and quantitative analysis is carried out for this purpose, to understand the extend of the existing researches, development, practice and application if any, of BDA and CA in FSA. © IJSTR 2020.",Big data analytics; Continuous auditing; External audit; Financial statements auditing; Internal audit,,International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research,Article,Final,Scopus,

In today’s digital business environment, it has become difficult to identify fraudulent transactions with traditional methods. Developments in information (data) and information technology have helped increase anti-fraud control programs and fraud research opportunities. In particular, fraudulent financial reporting disrupts the reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of financial markets in terms of existence and continuity. The forensic accounting profession has been able to improve the effectiveness of inspections by using big data techniques, data analytics, and algorithms (Rezaee, Lo, Ha, & Suen, 2016; Seda & Kramer, 2014; Singleton & Singleton, 2010). The aim of the author, in this chapter, is to evaluate the contribution of using big data techniques in forensic accounting applications and the skills that will be provided to students while integrating these techniques in forensic accounting trainings. For this purpose, studies on forensic accounting education and their applications were reviewed. In addition, opinions were evaluated by considering the relevant literature about the importance of big data, benefits of big data, use of big data techniques, and interest shown of them. © 2020 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

Design/methodology/approach: The analysis bases on semi-structured interviews with partners and senior managers of Italian audit companies. Findings: The BDA’s legitimation process is more advanced in the audit professional environment than outside the audit community. The Big Four lead the BDA-driven audit innovation process and BDA is used to complement traditional audit procedures. Outside the audit community, the digital maturity of audit clients, the lack of audit standards and the audit oversight authority’s negative view prevent the full legitimation of BDA. Practical implications: This research highlights factors influencing the utilization of BDA to enhance audit quality. The results can, thus, be used to enhance the audit strategy and to innovate audit practices by using BDA as a source of adequate audit evidence. Audit regulators and standards setters can also use the results to revise the current auditing standards and guidance. Originality/value: This study adds to the literature on digital transformation in auditing by analyzing the legitimation process of a new audit technique. The paper answers the call for more empirical studies on the utilization of BDA in financial auditing by analyzing the application of such techniques in an unexplored operational setting in which auditees are mainly medium-sized enterprises and family-run businesses. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Audit innovation; Audit technologies; Big data analytics; Legitimacy,,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,Article,Final,Scopus,

This standard is following ISA (International Standards on Auditing) No 600. With ISA600, group auditors are fully responsible for all parent and child financial reports, even though the child's financial statements are not audited by the group auditor. The impact of this full responsibility can cause group auditors to choose to carry out audits of component companies directly. This can lead to the possibility of a component auditor shift to the group auditor in order to minimise the risks that must be borne by the group auditor, because when involving other auditors as component auditors, the group auditor faces risks if the audit quality of other auditors is a low-quality component auditor. This study aims to examine the impact of the application of ISA600 on the share of the audit market in Indonesia. The research samples are companies that make consolidated financial statements. The companies that make the consolidation report are looked up by the names of their subsidiaries, then the names of Audit Firms and audit partners are searched based on data from P2PK of the finance ministry. The research period is from 2011 to 2016. The sample was obtained for 1,205 subsidiaries each year. To prove the hypothesis, a different test of market share was conducted in these 3 groups, before and after the application of ISA 600. The results showed that the market share of Big 4 rose 4.85%, Second Tier also increased by 1.74% while the small market share fell 6.56%. These findings are in accordance with complaints from many small Audit Firms that experienced a decrease in the number of clients due to the application of ISA 600. Therefore, the government needs to think about actions that need to be taken to protect small Audit Firms. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.",Audit market share; Component auditor; Group auditor; ISA600,,Primrose Hall Publishing Group,Article,Final,Scopus,

In the field of finance, “Internet + accounting” and big data auditing have also become hot topics in the industry. The Ministry of Finance and the Audit Office have also issued relevant documents in succession, proposing to strengthen the construction of information technology and increase the use of large data. With the emergence of cloud accounting and financial sharing centers, the trend of computerization of accounting data is further strengthened, which makes it possible to obtain direct activity information of enterprises through computers. On the other hand, the abundant data resources make the quantification process begin in various fields, and when big data is applied more and more widely, the acquisition of industry data and industry data will become more and more convenient. After introducing the research background and significance, this paper analyses the characteristics of audit analysis procedures in different stages of development, points out the limitations of traditional audit analysis procedures, and then leads to the significance of applying big data analysis to audit work. Next, we discuss the application of big data in audit analysis procedure. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",AI; Audit; Big data,Artificial intelligence; Finance; Activity informations; Audit; Audit analysis; Cloud computing technologies; Data resources; Different stages; Paper analysis; Relevant documents; Big data,Springer Verlag,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus,

User reservations and legal constraints however have given rise to questions about the verifiability of the integrity of the stored data, especially in the case of public cloud infrastructure. A new problem has hence arisen, that of auditing stored files in order to obtain Proof of Retrievability. Secure cloud storage systems are limited by the overheads they require in order to provide the required security levels. Combined use of cloud and local computational resources is necessary in order to enable the desirable user experiences. With increasing local processing capacities, the most significant relevance is encountered in the Big Data Processing paradigm. The volumes of data that need to be processed are overwhelming to such an extent that approaches which use unlimited amounts of power, for processing and storage are not feasible. This paper focuses on a recent study of hash function requirements for big data applications and an associated key – based hash function design technique that makes the real – time collection, summarization, analysis and decision making based on streaming data. A file auditing technique is proposed that uses fundamental big data mass processing operations in order to develop an efficient and reliable proof of recoverability algorithm. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Big data; Data auditing; Data mining; Data summarization; Hash functions; Proof of Retrievability; Secure cloud storage,Big data; Data handling; Data mining; Decision making; Design; Hash functions; Printing machinery; User experience; Computational resources; Data auditing; Data summarizations; Function requirements; Hardware and software; Processing operations; Proof of retrievability; Secure cloud storages; Digital storage,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,Scopus,

Findings: The existing audit practice aimed at identifying the fraud risk factors needs enhancement, due to the inefficient use of unstructured data. The brainstorming session provides a useful setting for such concern as it draws on collective wisdom and encourages idea generation. The integration of Big Data analytics into brainstorming can broaden the information size, strengthen the results from analytical procedures and facilitate auditors’ communication. In the model proposed, an audit team can use Big Data tools at every step of the brainstorming process, including initial data collection, data integration, fraud indicator identification, group meetings, conclusions and documentation.

We first introduce contemporary big data techniques to promote understanding of their potential application. Next, we review existing research on big data in accounting and finance. In addition to auditing, our analysis shows that existing research extends across three other genealogies: financial distress modelling, financial fraud modelling, and stock market prediction and quantitative modelling. Auditing is lagging behind the other research streams in the use of valuable big data techniques. A possible explanation is that auditors are reluctant to use techniques that are far ahead of those adopted by their clients, but we refute this argument. We call for more research and a greater alignment to practice. We also outline future opportunities for auditing in the context of real-time information and in collaborative platforms and peer-to-peer marketplaces. © 2017 University of Florida, Fisher School of Accounting",Auditing; Big data; Data analytics; Statistical techniques,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,Scopus,

Several studies investigated the impact of IT, in terms of the extent of use of IT audit techniques, but very studies are available on the perceived importance of the said issue in developing countries. This study aims to explore the impact of implementing IT on the auditing profession in a developing country, namely, Egypt. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey of 112 auditors, representing three of the Big 4 audit firms as well as ten local audit firms in Egypt, is used to gather preliminary data, and semi-structured interviews are conducted to gather details/qualitative-pertained information. A field-based questionnaire developed by Bierstaker and Lowe y(2008) is used in this study. This questionnaire is used first in conducting a pre-test, and then, the questionnaire for testing the final results is developed based on the feedback received from the test sample. Findings: The findings of this study reveal that auditors' perception regarding client's IT complexity is significantly affected by the use of IT specialists and the IT expertise of the auditors. Besides, they perceive that the new audit applications' importance and the extent of their usage are significantly affected by the IT expertise of the auditors. The results also reveal that the auditors' perception regarding the client's IT is not affected by the control risk assessment. However, the auditors perceive that the client's IT is significantly affected by electronic data retention policies. The results also indicated that the auditors' perception regarding the importance of the new audit applications is not affected by the client's type of industry. The auditors find that the uses of audit applications as well as their IT expertise are not significantly affected by the audit firm size. However, they perceive that the client's IT complexity as well as the extent of using IT specialists are significantly affected by the audit firm size. Research limitations/implications: This study is subject to certain limitations. First, the sample size of this research is somehow small because it is based on the convenience sampling technique, and some of the respondents were not helpful in answering the surveys distributed for this research's purpose. This can be attributed to the fear of the competitors that their opponent may want to gather information regarding their work to be able to succeed in the competition in the market so they become reluctant to provide any information about their firm. Even some people who were interested to participate were not having enough time because the surveys were distributed during the high season of their audit work and there was limited time for the research to be accomplished. Hence, it is difficult to generalize the results among all the audit firms in Egypt because this limits the scope of the analysis, and it can be a significant obstacle in finding a trend. However, this can be an opportunity for future research. Second, the questionnaire is long and people do not have enough time to complete it. This also affected the response rate. In addition to this, the language of the questionnaire was English, so some respondents from the local audit firms were finding difficulty in understanding some sophisticated IT terms. Practical implications: This study makes some recommends/suggestions that can well be used to solve some practical problems regarding the issues concerned. This study focuses on accounting information system (AIS) training during the initial years of the auditors' careers to help staff auditors when they become seniors to be more skilled with AIS expertise needed in today's audit environment. Clear policy statements are important to direct employees so that IT auditors evaluate the adequacy of standards and comply with them. This study suggests increasing the use of AIS to enhance individual technical and analytical skill sets and to develop specialized teams capable of evaluating the effectiveness of computer systems during audit engagements. This study further recommends establishing Egyptian auditing standards in this electronic environment to guide the auditors while conducting their audit work. Social implications: Auditors should prioritize causes of risks and manage them with clear understanding of who receives them, how they are communicated and what action should be taken in a given community/society. So, they have to determine and evaluate all risks according to the client's type of industry (manufacturing, non-financial services and financial). Auditors also have to continually receive feedback on the utility of continuous auditing (CA) in assessing risk. In particular, it is better for the auditor to determine how the audit results will be used in the enterprise risk management activity performed by the management. In addition, privacy has several implications to auditing, and so, it has to be reflected in the audit program and planning as well as the handling of assignment files and reports. Alike, retention of electronic evidence for a limited period of time may require the auditor to select samples several times during the audit period rather than just at year end. Originality/value: As mentioned, this study is conducted within a developing country's context. The use and importance of IT is reality of time. However, very few studies are devoted to explore the use/importance of IT in auditing in developing countries, and thus, this study carries a significance to have better understanding about it. Moreover, knowledge of how IT is used, the related risks and the ability to use IT as a resource in the performance of audit work is essential for auditor effectiveness at all levels including developing countries. © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Application; Audit; Developing country; Firm size; Information technology (IT); Procedures,,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,Article,Final,Scopus,

The paper contributes to the existing literature by identifying the peculiarity of the auditing firms in designing and implementing performance measurement systems including the need for sound and advanced information systems, subjectivity embedded in measuring customer satisfaction, growth and success of the firms and restrictions imposed by regulations and auditing standards for the provision of non-audit services which may increase the firms’ revenues and profits to help maintain high-quality outputs. Also, the paper provided evidence for the use of non-financial measures in service industry in particular for customers and finance. The unique dilemma in the auditing firms to provide services to satisfy customers yet maintaining distance and independence from them represent an important research question requiring investigation and study. Design/methodology/approach – A review of the literature for performance evaluation in general and in particular BSCs in service industries was made to identify challenges facing auditing firms when measuring their performance. Data were collected using case study approach; two auditing firms, one of the Big 4 and a medium size auditing firm with international affiliation operating in the Egyptian market were selected. Interviews, document analysis and participant observations were used in the analysis of each firm performance measurement system. Findings – The paper suggests that major challenges face auditing firms in measuring their performance mainly the size of the firm and its affiliation with international auditing firm, the qualification and experience of partners and audit managers needed for the design and implementation of a BSC or similar performance measures, the resources required for the introduction of such performance measure and the peculiarity of the auditor and client relationship with the need to maintain independence and confidentiality while providing high-quality services. Although both auditing firms being studied have formal performance measurement systems, they differ in their degree of comprehensiveness. In particular, the performance measurement system of the larger firm is more elaborate than that of the smaller one and both place more emphasis on qualitative measures such as learning and growth and internal business processes than financial measures. Research limitations/implications – Overall, the results have implications for understanding the performance measurement process of auditing firms in general and in particular in an emerging economy such as Egypt. The identification of the challenges facing auditing firms in measuring their performance and how the implementation of BSC can help partners and employees to overcome those challenges will add to the literature for performance evaluation in service companies. Future research should be carried to compare and assess differences between the behavioural aspects of performance measures in auditing firms and possible application of BSC in such firms and those used in services industry. Also, the practicality of implementing a BSC measures for different auditing firms should be investigated further in future research. Originality/value – The research among the first to investigate the challenges facing auditing firms in designing and operating a performance measurement system and to discuss, using case studies, how a BSC could support the auditing firms to overcome such challenges. Further, the research provides insights into performance measures in auditing firms in developing economies like Egypt which are sparse since most studies have been conducted in developed economies. Also, the paper enriches the literature of performance measurement systems in service rather than the manufacturing sector especially for medium and small size firms. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Auditing; Balanced scorecard; Performance measurement,,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,Article,Final,Scopus,
Kossovsky A.E.,"Benford’s law: Theory, the general law of relative quantities, and forensic fraud detection applications",2014,"Benford's Law: Theory, the General Law of Relative Quantities, and Forensic Fraud Detection Applications",,,,1,649,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013113383&doi=10.1142%2f9789814583695&partnerID=40&md5=5aa6bd504f7df21ab91903fd07f10772,"Contrary to common intuition that all digits should occur randomly with equal chances in real data, empirical examinations consistently show that not all digits are created equal, but rather that low digits such as {1, 2, 3} occur much more frequently than high digits such as {7, 8, 9} in almost all data types, such as those relating to geology, chemistry, astronomy, physics, and engineering, as well as in accounting, financial, econometrics, and demographics data sets. This intriguing digital phenomenon is known as Benford’s Law. This book gives a comprehensive and in-depth account of all the theoretical aspects, results, causes and explanations of Benford’s Law, with a strong emphasis on the connection to real-life data and the physical manifestation of the law. In addition to such a bird’s eye view of the digital phenomenon, the conceptual distinctions between digits, numbers, and quantities are explored; leading to the key finding that the phenomenon is actually quantitative in nature; originating from the fact that in extreme generality, nature creates many small quantities but very few big quantities, corroborating the motto ""small is beautiful"", and that therefore all this is applicable just as well to data written in the ancient Roman, Mayan, Egyptian, and other digit-less civilizations. Fraudsters are typically not aware of this digital pattern and tend to invent numbers with approximately equal digital frequencies. The digital analyst can easily check reported data for compliance with this digital law, enabling the detection of tax evasion, Ponzi schemes, and other financial scams. The forensic fraud detection section in this book is written in a very concise and reader-friendly style; gathering all known methods and standards in the accounting and auditing industry; summarizing and fusing them into a singular coherent whole; and can be understood without deep knowledge in statistical theory or advanced mathematics. In addition, a digital algorithm is presented, enabling the auditor to detect fraud even when the sophisticated cheater is aware of the law and invents numbers accordingly. The algorithm employs a subtle inner digital pattern within the Benford’s pattern itself. This newly discovered pattern is deemed to be nearly universal, being even more prevalent than the Benford phenomenon, as it is found in all random data sets, Benford as well as non-Benford types. © 2015 by World Scientific Publishing Co.
